Missing features:
-Check for game end -> handle game end
-Save button -> save current game state
-Seperate window tab for map creation
  -> set map size (eg. 6x6)
  -> set player count
  -> set current turn player
  -> set tiles (playerOwned, empty or mountain) (maybe just cycle the possible ones, when the tile is clicked)


Additional features:
-Change hover color of buttons somehow (it hides the playercolor completely, 50% aplha would be good or something)
-Change line style between the tiles (or just remove the line in between and add black borders to the buttons)
