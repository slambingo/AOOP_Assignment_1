## Missing features:
- Check for game end → handle game end
- Save button → save current game state
- Separate window tab for map creation
  - Set map size (e.g. 6x6)
  - Set player count
  - Set current turn player
  - Set tiles (playerOwned, empty or mountain)
    - Maybe just cycle the possible ones when the tile is clicked

## Missing Additional features (not needed):
- Change hover color of buttons (50% alpha so player color is still visible)
- Change line style between tiles (or remove lines and add black borders to buttons)
